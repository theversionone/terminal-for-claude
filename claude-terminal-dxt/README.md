## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute shell commands with timeout and error handling
- **Script Execution**: Run scripts in various interpreters (bash, PowerShell, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- **Process Management**: List and terminate processes
- **System Information**: Get comprehensive system details
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Security Features**: Configurable timeouts, buffer limits, and error handling
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive execution logs with timing information

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Claude Desktop application
- DXT CLI tool for packaging

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd claude-terminal-dxt
npm install
```

### Step 2: Install DXT CLI (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/dxt
```

### Step 3: Package the Extension

```bash
dxt pack .
```

This will create a `claude-terminal.dxt` file in your current directory.

### Step 4: Install in Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings â†’ Extensions
3. Click "Install Extension"
4. Select the `claude-terminal.dxt` file
5. Confirm the installation

## Usage

Once installed, Claude will have access to the following tools:

### 1. Execute Command

Execute shell commands directly:

```
Claude, run "ls -la" to list all files in the current directory
```

```
Claude, execute "git status" to check the repository status
```

### 2. Execute Script

Run scripts with specific interpreters:

```
Claude, run this Python script:
print("Hello from Python!")
import sys
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
```

```
Claude, execute this bash script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current user: $(whoami)"
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
```

### 3. System Information

Get comprehensive system details:

```
Claude, show me the system information
```

### 4. Process Management

List and manage processes:

```
Claude, list all running processes containing "node"
```

```
Claude, kill process with PID 1234
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
claude-terminal-dxt/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # DXT extension manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js        # MCP server implementation
â””â”€â”€ test/
    â””â”€â”€ test.js          # Basic test suite
```

### Testing

Run basic tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Test the server directly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Distribution

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

2. Package the extension:
   ```bash
   dxt pack .
   ```

3. The resulting `.dxt` file can be distributed and installed by users.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure Claude has necessary permissions to execute commands
2. **Command Not Found**: Verify the command/interpreter is installed and in PATH
3. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout values for long-running commands
4. **Buffer Overflow**: Large outputs may be truncated (10MB limit)

### Debug Mode

Run the server in debug mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with Node.js inspector for debugging.

### Logs

The server logs errors to stderr. Check the Claude Desktop console or terminal for detailed error messages.

## Security Considerations

This extension provides powerful capabilities that come with security implications:

1. **Full System Access**: Can execute any command the user can run
2. **File System Access**: Can read, write, and delete files
3. **Network Access**: Can make network requests and connections
4. **Process Control**: Can start and terminate processes
5. **Environment Access**: Can read environment variables and system information

### Best Practices

1. **Review Commands**: Always review commands before execution
2. **Limit Scope**: Use working directories to limit command scope
3. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of what commands are being executed
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the extension updated for security patches
5. **Backup Data**: Ensure important data is backed up before running destructive commands
